# SUPERVISED-AND-UNSUPERVISED-LEARNING-USING-R : 

Part one: [http://rpubs.com/CHEMAMET/] (I had to comment some codes and functions to allow the knitting of the file, because it was rendering for hours)

Part Two: http://rpubs.com/CHEMAMET/

This will contain my project for my understanding on supervised and unsupervised learning using R programming.

**OVERVIEW**

Online shopping is a form of electronic commerce which allows consumers to directly buy goods or services from a seller over the Internet using a web browser or a mobile app. Consumers find a product of interest by visiting the website of the retailer directly or by searching among alternative vendors using a shopping search engine, which displays the same product's availability and pricing at different e-retailers. As of 2020, customers can shop online using a range of different computers and devices, including desktop computers, laptops, tablet computers and smartphones. A typical online store enables the customer to browse the firm's range of products and services, view photos or images of the products, along with information about the product specifications, features and prices. Online stores usually enable shoppers to use "search" features to find specific models, brands or items.

**Project Description**

Kira Plastinina is a Russian brand that is sold through a defunct chain of retail stores in Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Belarus, China, Philippines, and Armenia. The brand’s Sales and Marketing team would like to understand their customer’s behavior from data that they have collected over the past year. More specifically, they would like to learn the characteristics of customer groups.

**Key Topics**

1. Problem Definition

2. Data Sourcing

3. Check the Data

4. Perform Data Cleaning

5.Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (Univariate, Bivariate & Multivariate)

6. Implement the Solution

7. Challenge the Solution

8. Conclusion 

9. Recommendation

**Success Criteria**

Our project will be considered a success if it can successfully identify the characteristics of customer groups which will help inform the team in formulating the marketing and sales strategies of the brand.
